This project focuses on accurately pricing affordable used cars in Ireland, using data collected in 2023 and 2024.
For detailed insights into the data collection and analysis, please refer to the Car Analysis Report PDF.

Note that the PDF does not include information on machine learning or neural networks, as these are implemented separately in the CarMLNN.ipynb notebook.

Feel free to use or adapt this project as needed.
